            My Game Design Manifesto*
            * mean to be very Strange and Offensive
            
            Games should leave something to players experience and to some extent change the person. Players need to have some aspects to remember after playing the game. I have played countless games in my life, but I can only remember a few of them now. I think it is a key point of game is to make players remember an aspect from the game. Good game is like a book which leaves something to the player. It could be the graphic, the story, or the format of the game. Those should be the meaningful parts of the game too.
            
            Games should be used to express designer's personal opinion to social topic. Games must have some opinion but not just purely for fun. The definition of social topic can be broad. Most people play games for fun. However, game designers should make sure that games are not only fun but also meaningful. Games should bring some idea to players. Those games do not need to be a story-based game. A simple puzzle game could also indicate some meaning by using specific assets and formats. The point is designers need to know what social topic of this game want to address. And think of it all the way during developing games.
            
            Games should have more than one endings. The definition of ending here includes open endings. The game should have a certain process, even an open-world multi-end game should have some stages and processes for the player. The content in the process of the play can be controlled by game designers. I do not want to make games that are endless such that players could continue to play to get as high scores as possible. In that way, designers will lose control of the game, players could go far away from the original meaning the game has. I also do not want to make one ending games, because it is too unconventional and monotonous.
