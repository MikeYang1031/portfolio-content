            This is a website for documenting my photography work, and it is also the final project of the website design and production course. The website will be continuously improved between September and December 2022. I'm a graduate student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, majoring in user experience design/research.
            This site is mostly an exercise, by the way, to organize my photography from childhood to adulthood. Speaking of which, I haven't had the urge to pick up a camera for a long time. When traveling, I just want to use my mobile phone to easily leave records. I don't want to give up this habit, even in the era of 5G and short video popularity, I think still-motion images still have enough appeal and effects that video can't achieve. I hope to take this opportunity to pick up the camera again, not just to record but to tell something.

            It is glorious.
It is Poisonous.
It is elegant but not pure.
It is fragile and mad.

The body is immortal, with no fault. What makes the pure beauty mixing with interferences. Wires, smartphone, flashlight and Circuit board occupy the focus points of frames. They also occupy most of the time in our life. They have got too much attention from us which is the thing has happened recently. They control, invade and infect the body. They should never be in that significant place. 

No matter caffeine, doping, cigarette, marijuana. Addictive things have inserted into our life. The pills seem like weight ten thousand pounds on human body. They are small but dark and important.  

Not even one face appears in the series. They are covered by electronic products. She is hiding. She is hiding from the world. She is hiding behind the internet. She is sinking in the internet. We have no idea who she is from the picture. Who knows who she is? Everyone on the internet knows who she is, however, they do not know who she “is”. Did she know about herself? 

The electronics are like pills, they both destroy the beauty of the frame, bringing the photos madness.

From static to dynamic, the picture is more and more unstable. The same as the person’s heart. I can see the struggling. There is suspicion of herself from the unclear and out of focus. She is fighting to come out of the comfort zone. She is fighting to smash the invisible and transparent boundary around her, like shatter the mirror. She is trying to change what has happened to her. She is fighting to set herself free.

Did she make it or not? I do not know. What I only know is that the demon has left trace on her body.
