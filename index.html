            This is a website for documenting my photography work, and it is also the final project of the website design and production course. The website will be continuously improved between September and December 2022. I'm a graduate student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, majoring in user experience design/research.
            This site is mostly an exercise, by the way, to organize my photography from childhood to adulthood. Speaking of which, I haven't had the urge to pick up a camera for a long time. When traveling, I just want to use my mobile phone to easily leave records. I don't want to give up this habit, even in the era of 5G and short video popularity, I think still-motion images still have enough appeal and effects that video can't achieve. I hope to take this opportunity to pick up the camera again, not just to record but to tell something.
