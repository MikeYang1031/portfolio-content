            Players do not have to pay attention to the content while playing the game. I want people to feel relaxed and have fun when they play the game. It does not mean the game needs to be easy to pass. A proper level of difficulty is important. The story or scene of the game could have some tricky parts, but the whole thing should always be easy to understand and follow. Do not throw mass information or stories to players in the short time. Always avoid making users frustrated about the game content. Have some mechanism to tolerate mistakes. Allow players to miss some of the information without big problems. Keep players stay with us.

            Games should make players learn what they want to learn on their own. Meaning should not be straightforward shown to the player. It should not look like a class or lecture. It is not a traditional boring educational interaction application. Games should not speak out what they are trying to express. They should not be forced to face something like a slogan or sentences after they go through the game. Designers need to express their thoughts using aspects of the game. If it is successful, players will come up with their own thoughts. It does not have to be a specific one, it is better to make different people come up with different feelings.
