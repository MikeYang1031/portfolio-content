            I have been playing with Grandpa's film camera since I was very young,
            from film cameras to point-and-shoot digital cameras, from SLR cameras
            to mobile phones. The equipment I used has changed a lot, but I still
            consider the equipment as the least important part in photography.
            The main point of filming is to express photographer's thoughts in
            the photos.

            At UW Madison, I was fortunate to take Professor Darcy
            Padilla's black and white film photography course. This purely
            primitive media allows me to focus more on the content itself.
            Her humanistic ideas of photography have a great influence on me.
